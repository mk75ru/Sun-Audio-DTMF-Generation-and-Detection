# Sun-Audio-DTMF-Generation-and-Detection
## Description

A C Program that can detect/generate Sun Audio DTMF files using only pointers with minimal header files 

## Usage

```
USAGE: this [-h] -g|-d [-t MSEC] [-n NOISE_FILE] [-l LEVEL] [-b BLOCKSIZE]
   -h       Help: displays this help menu.
   -g       Generate: read DTMF events from standard input, output audio data to standard output.
   -d       Detect: read audio data from standard input, output DTMF events to standard output.

            Optional additional parameters for -g (not permitted with -d):
               -t MSEC         Time duration (in milliseconds, default 1000) of the audio output.
               -n NOISE_FILE   specifies the name of an audio file containing "noise" to be combined
                               with the synthesized DTMF tones.
               -l LEVEL        specifies the loudness ratio (in dB, positive or negative) of the
                               noise to that of the DTMF tones.  A LEVEL of 0 (the default) means the
                               same level, negative values mean that the DTMF tones are louder than
                               the noise, positive values mean that the noise is louder than the
                               DTMF tones.

            Optional additional parameter for -d (not permitted with -g):
               -b BLOCKSIZE    specifies the number of samples (range [10, 1000], default 100)
                                in each block of audio to be analyzed for the presence of DTMF tones.
